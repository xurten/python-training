Parallel programming is a technique that allows for the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks.
This is particularly useful for applications that require intensive computations or that need
to handle multiple requests simultaneously.

Python offers several libraries for parallel programming, such as:
- multiprocessing_examples(allows for the creation of processes and managing them.
Each process operates in its own memory space and communicates with other
processes via IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms, such as queues and pipes.)

- concurrent.futures(module provides a high-level API for creating
a pool of threads or processes and running tasks in those pools.
It can be used to easily create multithreaded or multiprocess applications.
)
- threading(allows for the creation of threads. Threads are lighter than processes
and share the same memory space, which makes communication between them easier.
However, Python has a mechanism called GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), which limits execution
to one thread at a time)

Remember that parallel programming can be complicated due to issues related to
synchronization, races, and deadlocks. Therefore, itâ€™s important to thoroughly
understand these concepts before starting to write parallel code.
